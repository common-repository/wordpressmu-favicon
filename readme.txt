Adds a custom favicon to all WordPress/MU Blogs and Administration Panels! Originally based of the WordPress Admin Favicon Plugin by John Kolbert!

== Description ==

This plugin is based off of code from John Kolbert and his plugin, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-favicon/"> Admin Favicon</a>. While that plugin sticks a favicon only into the admin pages, this plugin was designed so that it would stick a favicon on every blog and every administrative page. Consider it basically a Site-Wide Favicon. It's useful for community sites that want to apply a favicon sitewide. As of now, unfortunately you need to manually enter the location of the favicon. Soon there will be an admin interface set up for it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wordpressmu-favicon.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (if you are using wordpress)
1A. Upload `wordpressmu-favicon.php` to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins` directory (if you are using wordpress mu)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress (if using wordpress)
2A. Do nothing if using WordPress MU
3. The Plugin works!
4. Edit the uploaded plugin file with the location of the the favicon.
